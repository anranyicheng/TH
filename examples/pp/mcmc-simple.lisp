;; PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
;;
;; estimate standard deviation of population using partial observations.
;; of course, this case should have analytic solution but i like to apply
;; markov chain monte caro, or metropolis-hastings algorithm.

;; to make standard deviation proposal as positive, log-normal is used
